> In James Tissot’s epic [The Life of Christ](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22J.+James+Tissot%22), a set of 350 watercolors, his naturalistic style coexists with a decidedly mystical or hallucinatory one, which earned him comparisons to William Blake. Tissot was a successful society painter who, after experiencing a religious vision in 1885, devoted the rest of his career to spiritual subject matter. He made two trips to Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, where he created extensive figure and landscape studies for his project, believing that this “pencil reporting from the life of Christ” would endow his scenes with historical accuracy.
