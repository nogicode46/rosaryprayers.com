# The Fifth Luminous Mystery

The Fifth Luminous Mystery is the Institution of the Eucharist. 

> And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body. 
> 
> And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this. For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.

*Matthew 26:26-28 (Douay-Rheims Bible)*
