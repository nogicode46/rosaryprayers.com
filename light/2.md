# The Second Luminous Mystery

The Second Luminous Mystery is the Wedding Feast at Cana.

*John 2:1-5*
> And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there. And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage. And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine. And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? my hour is not yet come. His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.

Fruit of the mystery: **To Jesus through Mary**
