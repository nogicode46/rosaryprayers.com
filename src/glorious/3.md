# The Third Glorious Mystery

The Third Glorious Mystery is the Descent of the Holy Spirit. 

> And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place: And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.

*Acts 2:1-4 (Douay-Rheims Bible)*

Fruit of the mystery: **Wisdom**
