# The Third Luminous Mystery

The Third Luminous Mystery is Jesus' Proclamation of the Coming of the Kingdom of God.

>And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
> 
> And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.

*Mark 1:14-15 (Douay-Rheims Bible)*
