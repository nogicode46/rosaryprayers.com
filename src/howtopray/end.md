# Closing Prayer

> Let us pray:  
> O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his life, Death, and Resurrection,  
> has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,  
> grant, we beseech Thee, that while meditating on these mysteries  
> of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,  
> we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise,  
> through the same Christ our Lord.  
> 
> Amen.
