# The Fourth Sorrowful Mystery

The Fourth Sorrowful Mystery is the Carrying of the Cross.

> And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross. And they bring him into the place *called* Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.

*Mark 15:21-22 (Douay-Rheims Bible)*

Fruit of the mystery: **Patience**
