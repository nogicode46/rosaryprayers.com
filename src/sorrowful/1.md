# The First Sorrowful Mystery

The First Sorrowful Mystery is the Agony in the Garden.  

> Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray. And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad. Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me. And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou *wilt*.

*Matthew 26:36-39 (Douay-Rheims Bible)*

Fruit of the mystery: **Obedience to God’s Will**
